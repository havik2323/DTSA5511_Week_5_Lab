# Monet GAN Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate Monet-style paintings from real-world photos. The project includes various GAN models, including a standard GAN, DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN), and CGAN (Conditional GAN). This repository also includes the hyperparameter tuning results, trained models, and sample outputs.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `best_model_output_images/`
This directory contains the output images generated by the best-performing GAN model after training. The images are the result of transforming input photos into Monet-style paintings using the optimized GAN.

### 2. `cgan_output/`
This folder contains the output images generated by the Conditional GAN (CGAN). The CGAN was trained with additional label information to condition the image generation process. The results here may vary in style and content based on the conditions provided during training.

### 3. `dcgan_output/`
This directory stores the output images produced by the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). The DCGAN is an enhanced version of the standard GAN, leveraging convolutional layers for better image synthesis, especially when dealing with higher resolution images.

### 4. `models/`
This directory contains the trained models, including the generator and discriminator for each GAN variant used in the project. These models can be loaded and reused for further image generation or fine-tuning.

### 5. `sample_inputs/`
This folder includes sample input images that were used to test the GAN models. These images are typical photos that were transformed into Monet-style paintings by the various GANs in the project.

### 6. `Monet_GAN_Implementation_Local.ipynb`
This is the Jupyter notebook that contains the entire codebase for implementing, training, and testing the GAN models. It includes all the necessary code for preprocessing, model building, training loops, and saving outputs.

### 7. `README.md`
This file provides an overview of the project, explains the purpose of each folder, and guides users on how to navigate the repository.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore the capability of GANs in generating art, particularly in transforming photos into Monet-style paintings. The project explores different GAN architectures, including the standard GAN, DCGAN, and CGAN, each offering a unique approach to image generation. The best model was selected based on a combination of discriminator and generator losses through an extensive hyperparameter tuning process.

### Models Implemented:
- **Standard GAN**: A basic Generative Adversarial Network with a generator and discriminator.
- **DCGAN**: A GAN that uses convolutional layers to improve the quality of generated images.
- **CGAN**: A GAN conditioned on additional input (e.g., labels) to control the image generation process.

### Results:
- The generated images are stored in respective folders under `best_model_output_images/`, `cgan_output/`, and `dcgan_output/`.
- The best model was identified through hyperparameter tuning and produced the highest quality Monet-style paintings as evidenced in the `best_model_output_images/` folder.

### Usage:
To run the code, navigate to the Jupyter notebook `Monet_GAN_Implementation_Local.ipynb`, and follow the instructions provided in the cells. The models saved in the `models/` directory can be loaded directly for inference or further training.

### Future Work:
- **Model Optimization**: Further hyperparameter tuning and architecture refinement.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance the dataset with augmented images to improve generalization.
- **GAN Variants**: Explore additional GAN variants such as StyleGAN or CycleGAN for potentially better results.
